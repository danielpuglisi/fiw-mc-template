# Friday is Webday Mailchimp Template

![Friday is Webday Mailchimp Template Screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)

A 1 column mailchimp email template for my weekly [Friday is Webday](http://danielpuglisi.com/fridayiswebday) newsletter.

It's a link/list heavy (4+ lists with 15+ links) newsletter and the template is optimized to beautify and make them more readable.

Feel free to fork, modify and do what you want with it.

Oh, and check out my side project [kurato.fm](http://kurato.fm). I use it for creating Friday is Webday.
